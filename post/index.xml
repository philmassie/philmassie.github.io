      <description>PU Learning Introduction Disclaimer: This post is not intended to be an exhaustive review of the PU learning approaches. Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s just me making some notes and storing them somewhere I can find them again, and where they may be helpful to someone else.
A challenge that keeps presenting itself at work is one of not having a well labelled set of negative cases in the context of needing to train a binary classifier.</description>

      <title>R Netcdf cheatsheet</title>

      <description>I recently promised a &amp;ldquo;NetCDF in R&amp;rdquo; cheat sheet to a friend, and I thought it might make a useful tutorial. NetCDF files are often used to distribute gridded, multidimensional spatial data such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a levels and so on. NetCDF is more than just a file format, and so googling it can be a little intimidating. I hope this helps make these files a little easier to use in R.</description>

      <title>South African municipal elections 2016</title>

      <description>A visual comparison of party effort across municipalities / districts With South Africa&amp;rsquo;s municipal elections in a few days time (3rd August 2016), I wondered about the effort being expended by the parties in each district or municipality. Has it increased or decreased since the 2011 elections? I must point out that I am not a political analyst or a political scientist. I am nevertheless a scientist with an appreciation for analytics.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is another post regarding some plots that I needed to make for a publication. As before, I relied heavily on Stack Exchange and many other sites for figuring out how to get my plot looking the way I needed it to, and so this is my attempt to contribute back to the broader community.
In my article I wanted a graphic which illustrated the preferred outward post-moult migration direction of adult female southern elephant seals from Marion Island.</description>

      <description>Introduction Preparing figures for publication can take a long time (well it does for me anyway), and I relied very heavily on numerous online resources to figure out some of the dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts. Obviously I owe massive thanks to the hundreds of blogs and Stack Exchange questions and answers I relied on. Where I can, I will try to link to them.
Additionally, this tutorial covers a little bit about working with reshaped gridded data, shape files, GeoTIFF data and even a simple homemade polygon.</description>
