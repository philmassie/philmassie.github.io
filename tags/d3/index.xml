      <description>Introduction With South Africa&amp;rsquo;s municipal elections in a few days time (3rd August 2016), I wondered about the effort being expended by the parties in each district or municipality. Has it increased or decreased since the 2011 elections? I must point out that I am not a political analyst or a political scientist. I am nevertheless a scientist with an appreciation for analytics.
Employing and promoting candidates costs money. Assuming that our political parties don&amp;rsquo;t have infinite financial resources it follows that investigating where they invest their resources may be a reasonable proxy for effort.</description>
