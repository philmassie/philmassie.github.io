      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a data scientist trained in statistical ecology. I have degrees in conservation biology, marine biology and oceanography but now work in the financial services sector as park of a great team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked for many years in web development, client and server side, and have a good working knowledge of various server architecture stacks and have experience in numerous scripting languages. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the combination of my IT experience and science skills and mindset has prepared me well for a career in data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other hobbies include photography and occasionally some surfing. Unfortunately there don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be enough hours in the day to do all the odds and ends I want to and so work and family are my primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love the outdoors and an a bit of a bird nerd. I find birds beautiful and fascinating and love watching them and trying (and usually failing) to photograph them. Some of these posts will probably be pretty random photos of birds. I strive to be a good naturalist, and at this rate that will take the rest of my life. That&amp;rsquo;s fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;
