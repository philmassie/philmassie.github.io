      <description>I am a data scientist trained in statistical ecology. I have degrees in conservation biology, marine biology and oceanography but now work in the financial services sector as park of a great team.
I worked for many years in web development, client and server side, and have a good working knowledge of various server architecture stacks and have experience in numerous scripting languages. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the combination of my IT experience and science skills and mindset has prepared me well for a career in data science.</description>
